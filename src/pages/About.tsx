              At Job Seekers 4 High Schools, our mission is to bridge the gap between high school education and 
              meaningful career opportunities. We empower students with the skills, resources, and connections 
              they need to succeed in today's rapidly evolving job market.

            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
              While platforms like LinkedIn target professionals and Indeed takes a broad approach, we focus exclusively 
              on high school students aged 16-18 who are often overlooked by mainstream job platforms.

                According to a 2023 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report, approximately 34% of 16-19-year-olds 
                were in the labor force, yet many struggle to find age-appropriate jobs.
